#      A call back function is a function passed as an arguement to another function, if gets called back after some opertaion
#      is completed . 
     
#      how it works :
         
#         Passing a function as a parameter means:
# You give one function to another function.
# The second function does its work.
# When itâ€™s ready (or when something finishes), it calls back the first function you gave.
