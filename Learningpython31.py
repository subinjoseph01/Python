# File handling : File handling in the python reffers to the process od creating opening 
# reading , writing , closing files through python ConnectionAbortedError

# kEY POINTS ABOUT FILE HANDLING:
    
#     opening a file ,# you open a file using the build in open() # open function called parantasis
    
#     # syntax : file = open(file name, mode )
    
#     # modes types are : r , w , a append , x create .
    
#     Read :
#         types of read : 
            
#                         read line and read lines 
                        
                        
                        
    # write :
    #      types are 
    #              : write line and write 
    #               write line indicates to write a list of strings
    #               and write is normal write
                  
                  
# Append :
    #    add content without erasing existing data        
    
    # Closing : 
    #     use =  file.close() 
        
    #     to close the file . 
    #     and 
    #     use with  statment , that automatically closes the file            
                        
                        
# Handling exception : use try except  blocks , to handle  error like file not found

# Error handling is a way to stop your program from crashing when something goes wrong.

# Instead of breaking, you tell the program:
# üëâ ‚ÄúIf this part causes a problem, do this instead.‚Äù

# In Python, we use try and except for this.

# try ‚Üí Put the risky code here.

# except ‚Üí What to do if an error happens.

# else ‚Üí What to do if no error happens.

# finally ‚Üí Always runs, for cleanup.
