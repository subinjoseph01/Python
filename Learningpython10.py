#  Here we have done the problem 
#  School Trip Permission
# Ask the user to enter age and check whether they have parental permission (yes/no).
# •⁠  ⁠If the age is 10 or more, then:
# o	If the user has parental permission, print: "You can go on the school trip."
# o	Otherwise, print: "You need parental permission to go on the school trip."
# •⁠  ⁠If the age is less than 10, print: "You are too young for the school trip."
